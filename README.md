## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Cloudinary (for image storage)
- Vercel (for deployment)

## Features

- User registration with email verification
- User authentication using JWT tokens
- Profile management with the ability to update name, email, password, and profile picture
- Course management for superadmin users, including CRUD operations
- Course enrollment with validation to prevent duplicate enrollments
- Filtering and pagination for course listings
- Integration with Cloudinary for profile picture storage

## Getting Started

To get started with the E-Learning Platform, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables, including MongoDB connection string, Cloudinary credentials, and JWT secret.
4. Run the server using `npm start`.
5. Access the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl.

## Usage

Once the server is running locally, you can use the following API endpoints:

- `/api/v1/user/register`: Register a new user.
